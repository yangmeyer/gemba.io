# Howdy, developer!
# Your designer is using Gemba to push assets directly into this Git repo. Woohoo!
# 
# With Gemba, designers can update existing assets all by themselves, without your help.
# New assets are put in a default directory. You can move them (e.g. into an Asset Catalog),
# and subsequent updates from the designer will go to that new location.
# 
# This YAML file lets you tweak how Gemba uses this repo. Push changes to this file,
# and your designers will be using your updated config next time they use Gemba.
# Contact support@gemba.io for any questions.
