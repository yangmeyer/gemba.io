	<h3>New Features</h3>
		<ul>
	    	<li>Xcode asset Catalog support (beta): add @3x assets to image sets with existing @1x/@2x counterparts. (See below for how-to and limitations.)</li>
			<li>Repositories can now be removed.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Crash after moving an asset remotely and dropping an update before the repository could pull. </li>
    	<li>Could not connect to repository if Xcode is installed but was never launched; now shows alert with instructions to launch Xcode and accept its license.</li>
    	<li>Cancel cloning dismissed UI but continued in the background.</li>
    	<li>Could not open repository where the remote URL used for creating it did not match with the actual remote URL specified in the .gemba file that existed remotely.</li>
    	<li>Truncated asset warnings.</li>
    	<li>Selected-repository marker not always pointing to shown repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UI Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>New app icon.</li>
    	<li>Streamlined asset list, grouped by folder / image set.</li>
    	<li>Re-organized top bar; clearer connection between asset filter and list.</li>
    	<li>Delivery notes layout now matches commit message.</li>
    	<li>Show number of assets in tabs.</li>
    </ul>

	<h3>Asset Catalog how-to</h3>

	<p>Add an @3x asset to an existing image set (that already contains corresponding @1x or @2x assets) by dropping it into Gemba. The image set’s Contents.json will be updated automatically, and it will appear alongside the new @3x asset in the asset list.</p>
	    
	<h3>Asset Catalog limitations</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Gemba expects the traditional naming convention: “icon[@3x][~ipad].png”</li>
		<li>Not supported yet: Adding new image sets to an asset catalog.</li>
		<li>No plans to support: “Launch Image” sets, creating new asset catalogs, asset slicing, size classes, device-specific “568h” assets.</li>
	</ul>
