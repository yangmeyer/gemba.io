	<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>"1 assets" in commit message.</li>
	<li>Assets with different-case file extension were silently ignored, e.g. PNG vs png.</li>
	<li>Branches added remotely did't show up in branches list.</li>
	<li>Discarding committed-but-unpushed assets didn’t work properly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Improvements</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Show all assets in repository, or just your undelivered changes.</li>
	<li>Added option to open repository in Terminal.</li>
	<li>Added feedback after dragging in unchanged assets.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Known Issues</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Discard/QuickLook are not disabled when no unchanged assets are selected.</li>
	<li>Remotes are always (and must be) named "origin".</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks again for your feedback and bug reports! Let me know of any problems you come across: yang@gemba.io</p>
